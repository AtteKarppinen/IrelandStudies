Terminology:

plaintext       = original message
ciphertext      = coded message
cipher          = algorithm for encryption
key             = info used in cipher
encipher        = converting plaintext to ciphertext
decipher        = vice versa
cryptoanalysis  = study of principles / methods of deciphering without knowing key
cryptology      = field of both cryptography and cryptoanalysis

Encryption

Symmetric
    Or conventional / private-key / single-key
    Sender and receiver share the same key

Asymmetric
    or two-key / public-key 

Unconditional security
    Unbreakable cipher. No matter how much computing power
    or time given. Ciphertext provides insufficient infro
    to uniquely determine the corresponding plaintext.

Computational security
    Given limited computing resources, cipher is Unbreakable.
    E.g. universe's time will end before cipher is cracked.


Playfair example
    plaintext   = come to the window
    key         = SHERLOCK

    S   H   E   R   L
    O   C   K
